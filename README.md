# IEEE-CIS-Fraud-Detection-using-R

The "IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection using R" is a GitHub repository that provides a comprehensive implementation of fraud detection techniques using the R programming language. This repository focuses on analyzing and detecting fraudulent transactions in the context of the IEEE-CIS (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers - Computational Intelligence Society) Fraud Detection Competition.

Key Features:

Dataset Description: The repository offers a detailed description of the dataset used for fraud detection. It provides insights into the data structure, variable types, and the target variable that indicates fraudulent transactions.

Installing Required Packages: A guide is provided on installing the necessary R packages required for executing the code in the repository. This ensures a seamless setup for users to reproduce the fraud detection project.

Importing the Data: The repository provides code snippets to import the dataset into R, making it readily available for analysis and modeling.

Data Preprocessing & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The repository focuses on data preprocessing and EDA techniques. It covers important tasks such as handling missing values, transforming datetime columns, visualizing class imbalance, and exploring the distribution of transaction amounts.

Feature Engineering: The repository demonstrates feature engineering techniques to enhance the predictive power of the fraud detection models. This includes encoding categorical variables, stratified sampling, and deriving new features from the existing dataset.

Baseline Random Forest Model: The repository trains a baseline Random Forest model using parallel processing techniques. It provides code snippets and guidelines to train the model and evaluate its performance.

Building a LightGBM Model: The repository goes beyond the baseline model and explores the LightGBM algorithm for fraud detection. It presents a function to train a LightGBM model, performs cross-validation, and conducts a grid search to identify the optimal model parameters.

Feature Importance and Interpretability: The repository offers techniques to compute and interpret feature importance in the LightGBM model. Users can identify the top 20 important features and gain insights into their contribution to fraud detection.

Local Interpretation of the LightGBM Model: The repository provides code and explanations for locally interpreting the LightGBM model. Techniques such as permutation importance, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) are employed to understand the model's decision-making process.

References: The repository includes a reference section with relevant sources, articles, and research papers related to fraud detection and the techniques applied in the project.
